Soil-Moisture-Detection
This project uses Arduino-based sensors to measure real-time soil moisture and triggers alerts when the soil becomes too dry or too wet. I also integrated a machine learning model to predict soil type, helping optimize irrigation and improve resource usage.
ech Used:

Arduino • Soil Moisture Sensor

Python • Machine Learning

Real-time Alert System



Real-time soil moisture monitoring

Automatic alert notifications

ML-based soil type prediction

Helps farmers make smarter irrigation decisions
